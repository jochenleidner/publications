  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is already used for decision-making in practice (Lossos/ Geschwill/Morelli 2021), increasingly also in the insurance sector. However, it requires trust in the various AI methods, especially in the evaluation of companies („ratings“). Trust is formed when decision makers and users can form mental models of a system and they understand its output. AI must therefore be explainable; a pure black box is insufficient even if a system is of high quality. „Explainable AI“ (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence, XAI) is concerned with the development of AI models that are comprehensible by humans (Adadi/Berrada 2018; European Commission 2020). In this paper, desirable properties of industrial AI systems are investigated – specifically with respect to explainability – and presented and visualized using the application example of ratings of German life insurance companies. In addition to XAI as one prerequisite for technical acceptance, the interaction between the business model and customer acceptance of ratings of German life insurance companies is examined. Financial key performance indicators for German life insurance companies are often said to lack transparency; this is still the case when HGB accounting is supplemented by the Solvency and Financial Condition Reports (SFCR) according to Solvency II. We argue that the examination of explainable AI methods is a useful contribution to the practice of valuation.},

  abstract = {To date, automatic summarization methods have been mostly developed for (and applied to) general news articles, whereas other document types have been neglected. In this paper, we introduce the task of summarizing financial earnings call transcripts, and we present a method for summarizing this text type essential for the financial industry. Earnings calls are briefing events common for public companies in many countries, typically in the form of conference calls held between company executives and analysts that consist of a spoken monologue part followed by moderated questions and answers.We show that traditional methods work less well in this domain, we present a method suitable for summarizing earnings calls. Our large-scale evaluation on a new human-annotated corpus of summary-worthy sentences shows that this method outperforms a set of strong baselines, including a new one that we propose specifically for earnings calls. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of summarization to financial earnings calls transcripts, a primary source of information for financial professionals.},

  abstract = {In this demonstration, we present Country Guesser, a live system that guesses the country that a photo is taken in. In particular, given a Google Street View image, our federated ranking model uses a combination of computer vision, machine learning and text retrieval methods to compute a ranking of likely countries of the location shown in a given image from Street View. Interestingly, using text-based features to probe large pre-trained language models can assist to provide cross-modal supervision. We are not aware of previous country guessing systems informed by visual and textual features.},
